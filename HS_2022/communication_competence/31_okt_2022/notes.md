- Personal e.g.:

> Wouldn't you feel unsafe? Wouldn't you have concerns about the outcome of this operation?

- Good structure: first a problem is presented then a solution is offered

#### What needs improvement

> Assisted learning through virtual reality

- It is not clear that it is meant specifically for surgeons

### Vocabulary and Grammar
