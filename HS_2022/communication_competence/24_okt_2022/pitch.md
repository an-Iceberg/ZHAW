### Laser induced fusion

- i would like to present you laser induced n.f.

- the process takes place within a spherical reactor where all lasers pointing to the center where the helium is located

- january 2021:

  - results:

    - NIF  same energy gain as JET

- promising future for the technology,

- doesn't carry the same risks (radiactivity and instability)

- lasers have become very economically viable and their reusability is also very high

### Why should you care

- energy consumption of humanity is on the rise, fusion offers a solution for that

- green energy, no carbon emissions, contribution in combatting climate change

- unlimited resources -> ocean water
