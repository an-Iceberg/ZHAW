### Laser induced fusion

- i would like to present you laser induced nuclear fusion

- the process takes place within a spherical reactor where a large set of very strong lasers are pointing to the center where the hydrogen is located

- january 2021:

  - NIF achieved exciting results:

    - managed to match the energy output of the JET

- promising for future of this technology,

- doesn't carry the same risks (walls becoming radioactive over time and instability of plasma)

- lasers are also a lot more economically viable, maintainable and reusable than the Tokamak

### Why should you care

- energy consumption of humanity is on the rise, fusion offers a solution for that

- green energy, no carbon emissions, contribution in combatting climate change

- uses a virtually limitless resource available on this planet namely ocean water
