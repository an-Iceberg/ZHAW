### Laser induced fusion

- i would like to present you laser induced n.f.

- the process takes place within a spherical reactor where a large set of very strong lasers are pointing to the center where the hydrogen is located

- january 2021:

  - NIF results:

    - managed to match the energy output of the JET

- promising future for the technology,

- doesn't carry the same risks (radiactivity and instability)

- lasers have become very economically viable and a lot easier to maintain than the Tokamak

### Why should you care

- energy consumption of humanity is on the rise, fusion offers a solution for that

- green energy, no carbon emissions, contribution in combatting climate change

- unlimited resources -> ocean water
